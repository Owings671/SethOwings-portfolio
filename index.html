Hardworker, loved by employees and customers alike. He thrived as a young person on his team where he quickly became a lead! He worked for me when he was in college as a support engineer. He was just finishing high school at that time, but I found him to be a very fast learner, team player and made a huge impressions on all the employees at Visioneer plus customers he helped.   His work ethics is impressive and works very well with everyone.  He is a great team mate to have on board. I believe he can thrive in any situation!    Further, he was a standout running back on his football team which I think is a great trait to have in any young person - TEAM WORK! I am glad I got to work with Seth and see what he is capable of at such a young age and see that he can grow and thrive into whatever he sets his mind to! I welcome the day to work again with Seth without hesitation. <img class="right_quote" src="./page_images/quote_left.png" alt="Left Quotation"/></p>

Seth has showcased his intelligence, quick wits, and knowledge on a variety of subjects such as computer science, politics, and sciences. Seth is a great individual for any company and I highly recommend him for any position possible. <img class="right_quote" src="./page_images/quote_left.png" alt="Left Quotation"/></p>
